#Concerts in Town

<p>
  This is a small CLI app I made to help me learn ECMAScript 6. It leverages the Bands in Town API to fetch concerts near you based on the artist you search for.
<p>
<p>
  To run, simply clone the repo, run npm install, and then nvm exec npm start (it has a dependency on a certain version of node).
